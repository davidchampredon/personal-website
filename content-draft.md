How do infectious diseases spread in populations? For most of our [history](https://www.lemonde.fr/), we did not even ask the question: plagues and other terrifying diseases swiped through villages and cities, killing or sickening people indiscriminately. Epidemics were not only terrifying, they were also mysterious: our explanations of why they appear and stay among our community often call for supernatural powers (e.g., Gods, witchcraft). Essentially, we were defenceless against epidemics.

It is only recently, less than 200 years ago, that we understand that micro-organisms cause infectious diseases and can be transmitted between individuals (some pathogens also involve animals or insects).
We have also understood how pathogens cause disease and developed  efficient tools against many of them: drugs to eliminate or weaken the pathogenic effects and vaccines to bluntly prevent infection. 

When pathogens manage to go through our therapeutic nets, epidemiological studies investigate potential spread patterns in populations. Are some groups of the populations at higher risks of infections? How is the pathogen transmitted? ((another question)) Answers to those questions help to guide public health responses aiming to reduce the number of infections. 

But even today, despite all our advances against infectious diseases, we often operate in a "fog of war" when facing an epidemic. Indeed, for various reasons, ranging from ((XXX to XXX)), newly infected individuals cases are rarely systematically reported in a timely fashion. In other words, epidemics are usually poorly observed, making it very difficult to identify meaningful patterns of transmission in the population affected. And even when an epidemic is fairly well observed, public health agencies often want to identify the most efficient / cost-effectives interventions. Finding those optimal interventions can be quite challenging given the uncertainty and complexity of the mechanisms driving an epidemic.

This is when my research kicks in. Using mathematics, statistics and computers, I model epidemics of infectious diseases to understand their transmission dynamics, and ultimately help guiding epidemic responses. 

We can translate the disease transmission process into equations, and feed them to  mathematical theorems to get precise results about various epidemic outcomes. This allows us to understand the fundamental mechanisms at play during an epidemic. But unfortunately, a complete mathematical analysis is only feasible when we simplify drastically the description of epidemics.
